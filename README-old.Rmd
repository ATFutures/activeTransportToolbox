## WIP
#### from rplumber.io

Only one R script `plumber.R`

### dir structure
at whoIIproto/plumber directory, final structure is as follows, see next section to have this:
```
plumberTest$ tree -L 2
├── README.md
├── run.png
├── server
│   └── plumber.R           <== main plumber R script
├── static
│   ├── build               <== RectJS client side code which must be kept away from public
|   ├── node_modules        <== npm managed modules and not checked into git
│   ├── package.json        <== nmp main package manager config
│   ├── package-lock.json   <== ignore this :)
│   ├── public              <== all publicly exposed files (served by plumber)
│   ├── README.md
│   └── src                 <== RectJS client side code which must be kept away from public
└── v0.png
```


### to run

After cloning repo,

```bash
# run in RStudio with Ctl-Alt-Enter
cd plumber/static
npm install
npm run build
cp build/* -r public
```

Now you should have above dir scructure.

You will then need R package plumber

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("plumber") #should install without issues at least on Ubuntu 16 & 18 did.
library(plumber)

# go to plumber/static directory to run plumber.R
old_dir = setwd("plumber/static/") # if starting from repo root
r = plumb("../server/plumber.R")
r$run(port = 8000)
# You should see:
# Starting server to listen on port 8000
# Running the swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8000/__swagger__/
setwd(old_dir) # move back to original wd when done
```

This means that [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) is now showing `region1.geojson`, served from the endpoint [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/json`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/json). 

The endpoint itself [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/json`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/json) returns an `unboxedJSON` 
using plumber's directives.

### curl examples

```bash
curl --data "a=4&b=6" "http://localhost:8000/sum"
# 10
```

### to develop

We have two separate development environment going on here. The `plumber` which deals with the server side and `react-create-app` aka CRA which manages the client side.

Once in `plumber/static` directory you can run the CRA dev server by

`$ npm start`

You can continue editing the R code using the main project `whoIIproto.Rproj`.
